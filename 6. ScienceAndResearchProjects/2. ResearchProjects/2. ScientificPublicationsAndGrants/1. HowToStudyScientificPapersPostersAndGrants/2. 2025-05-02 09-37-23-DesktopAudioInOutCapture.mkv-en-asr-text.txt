00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.280
okay so we are doing science class now
yes sir

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:19.560
so what did we do in the last class
in the last class we learned

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:26.080
about how to
read scientific articles how to write

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.640
scientific articles the problems in the
review

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.679
proc reproducibility

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:42.960
reproduce produce means to make it again
to produce means to make it to make it

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:49.800
reproduce means make it again
reproducibility means making it again

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.800
yeah problems in reproducibility

00:00:51.879 --> 00:01:03.120
and and about review process
and about review process okay so explain

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.320
everything starting from how you do uh
how you write a scientific article first

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:12.479
you do your scientific research right
yes how do you do scientific research

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.960
first write the title and I'm not
talking about article first you have to

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.720
do the research right yes so how do you
do this research are you asking the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.000
steps of how to do the research yes in
the beginning I write the title this is

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.320
article virata this is writing an
article do you start with writing an

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.759
article or do you first do the research
i do the research how do you do the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.520
research in the research in the
beginning I write the title

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:49.040
why will you write the title you're not
writing anything i'm asking you how do

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:55.680
you do your research first
um I don't understand your how do you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.240
you are studying something yes so how do
you do

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.240
that i'm not asking about how you write
an article in an article you'll have the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.800
title you'll have other things yes we
are not writing anything we doing

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:15.520
research how do you do this
um are you asking what are the steps

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:20.720
like scientific method yes so what do
you follow to do the research first I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:28.080
what is it called what's that process
called you just mentioned a review

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:34.599
process no it's scientific method you
follow the scientific method to to

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:39.040
perform your research yes right
huh what are the different steps in

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.239
scientific method that you follow the
first one is our question what are we

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.080
trying to do so again when you're
writing that's all part of like the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.080
background right introduction so people
have already done some research so

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.920
you're reading that research yes you're
not writing anything right now you first

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.920
you have to understand what's already
done right then what then you have to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.920
find your question like what's missing
and then you come up with a question

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:13.280
that you want to answer yes then what
and then I do data collection so you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:18.319
come up with a hypothesis right yes
hypothesis is something that you can

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.879
test yes and then and then I test then
you collect the data yeah collect the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:28.080
data
and then I make the hypothesis you don't

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.360
collect the data and make hypothesis mhm
you collect you make the hypothesis and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.480
then collect data mhm then I test the
hypothesis using this data using the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:46.480
data uh
and if

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:54.879
if if some of my hypothesis was wrong
I'll make a improved hypothesis and that

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:59.920
test test that hypothesis using data
and then and then you might have to

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:07.200
collect more data right yes and then
test using the new data yeah and then if

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:13.680
the data works if the if that data works
hypothesis works

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.759
I get my conclusion your conclusion is
that okay this is true for example that

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.440
the earth is rotating the sun or the sun
is rotating the earth right that's you

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:29.280
come up with a conclusion okay now you
have so those are your results so now

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:35.199
you are putting together all of this
research into a paper

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:41.680
so how do you write the paper first I
write the title then I write the title

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:48.639
is just describing like very briefly
what is it what it is about yeah then I

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:55.280
explain about others
you just it's just a list of names right

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:02.560
you're not explaining anything well you
you also tell like which university or

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:09.840
school they are from h Yeah h and then I
I do explain the abstract abstract means

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:14.360
like one paragraph of what this whole
paper does

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.479
what
uh what this paper does and what are the

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:24.240
main findings
it's not just about the methods right

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.919
abstract is about like everything else
that you have in the paper it's just

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:36.160
like a summary the main findings yeah
and then introduction

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:42.000
in introduction I explain what is what
was done before by others

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.400
um what is missing and what are we
trying to do

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:56.240
and after that it's methods methods I'll
do all the research

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:02.960
you're not doing the research you
describe what in methods i

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.400
describe how we'll do this research
so what does methods include what are

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:14.000
the different things you can have in
methods in methods I can have

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:19.520
um we can do we we are following
scientific method you explain like how

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.880
you're collecting the data for example
you have to collect data from people's

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:29.039
brains you'll use some equipment right
yeah so you have to describe which

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:35.120
equipment you're going to use and what
else and then I have the results no I'm

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.319
talking about methods what else does
methods include

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:47.520
it can
have my hypothesis

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:53.919
okay and and then I test the hypothesis
in that yes Vat but what what are the

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.160
different things that methods uh section
we have

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:03.599
i just told you you describe the
equipment that you're going to use and

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:10.080
what else and then how you're collecting
the data right yes then what do you do

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:14.240
with that data um with the data
just by looking at the data you'll not

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:18.319
know anything right I have I collected
the time at which the time and direction

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:22.160
from which the sun rises on 100
different days i have it in an Excel

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:27.599
file then what how do you come to a
conclusion or how how are you going to

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.560
test i'm going to make a hypothesis yes
and then how are you going to test that

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:39.440
hypothesis using this data i have 100
rows with four different

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:44.400
columns like the date the time at which
sunrise happened the time at which

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:49.680
sunset happened and the direction from
which the sun came up and the direction

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:55.280
from which the sun came down went down i
have all of these for every day right so

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.800
it's a lot of data then we have to do
something with this data to test the

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:05.360
hypothesis right what are you going to
do

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:10.560
um I have to make my results how are you
going to get that result from the from

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.960
those from the data how are you going to
get the results

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:26.479
um every day if if something is
repeating or if anything is same I make

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:30.800
the data as this this will happen every
day or this will repeat for every day so

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.440
what are you trying to do you're
analyzing this data like you can do it

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:39.519
in Python right you have 100 different
values you're adding it subtracting

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:45.440
doing something yes that's called data
analysis you could be using Excel to do

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:49.920
this right you could do uh like simple
computations in Excel or you can use

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:53.360
Python or you can use something else so
you have to describe all of that in your

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.279
methods how are you going to do the data
analysis if you have other things that

00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:03.640
you're doing in your research you
describe all of that in the method

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.640
section okay then what

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:14.160
then in method after methods what do you
have after method I have the results so

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:19.760
this is what you used you collected the
data you analyzed your data and then you

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:26.320
have some results how are you going to
describe the results

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:31.800
um how did you describe in your poster
i described that what were the results

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:38.000
in your poster my results
were the main findings right what were

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.000
they yeah

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:49.760
um I'm thinking sir so which part of
your poster was the results what what

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:54.080
did you have there was it the methods no
like where you described Python and

00:09:51.360 --> 00:10:00.519
other things were those the results no
was scientific method the results no

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:06.160
what was the result the result
was those waves those functions

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:12.120
functions
um was the Python function was the

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.120
result no huh

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.040
the result was that

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:25.200
I don't remember where we wrote those
results we did not say it's results

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:32.399
Virata but think about it what were you
showing people um conclusion

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:37.839
conclusion is the main it's like a
summary forget the conclusion

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:42.640
um where were you describing your
results to people how were you

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:46.720
describing it
in the scientific method you're

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.720
describing results in scientific method
no

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.480
i am describing

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.160
you did not call them results we did not
have a heading that said results okay we

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:09.839
called it something else but what were
your findings from this uh study vir

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:16.800
the findings from that study was what
did you find out what did you learn

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:23.600
i learned that when I changed changed
wave properties the waves will change

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:29.600
depending on those properties the how
the waves looked changed how did you

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:37.200
show this in your poster with the waves
images you showed it as images those are

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:42.560
the results okay so you show results uh
you don't always show I mean you can

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:49.600
show it as tables like uh or you can
show it using images okay that show

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:56.200
what's changing okay mhm so that's part
of your results then what

00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:03.519
then I have
my h conclusion what's the conclusion

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:08.160
conclusion is no before conclusion you
we talked about another section

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:13.760
discussion discussion is where you
describe how each of these results what

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:18.880
what does it mean for example in your
poster uh when you change the frequency

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:24.639
of the wave
uh you show that the number of waves

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:30.079
that you see within the same time are
increasing right yes that's the result

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:36.320
then you explain in in discussion you
explain why that might be the case why

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:41.839
this is happening okay uh that's what uh
discussion uh section will have huh yeah

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:45.680
sir can and then there's conclusion and
then there's conclusion is like the main

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:53.600
like a summary of your results it's kind
of similar to the abstract also okay the

00:12:48.880 --> 00:13:02.399
main findings yes sir can you write like
all the steps in in scientific paper in

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:10.000
the classrooms like here we write we ask
this title one is

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:15.200
title two is abstract
three is

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:21.200
introduction four is materials
and methods okay like your recipe for if

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:26.000
you're cooking this is your recipe
others if they want to make the same

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:31.639
thing they need to follow this method
then results we did this right I don't

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:37.639
need to write it again here
discussion so how are you going to

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:42.800
interpret those results then
conclusion the main thing from the story

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:49.839
and then references and then references
are like what we used what we uh Yeah

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:56.320
how to make research openly available to
everyone did you read this part

00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:02.000
yes sir did I explain this i think I may
have gone over it like briefly right

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:06.639
open access journals some journals are
open access means yeah that means we

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:11.199
don't need to pay them any yeah i mean
not everybody can pay there some of them

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:15.760
are like very expensive that means
they're very costly you need to pay a

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:20.720
lot of money not everyone can pay that
much money to read scientific articles

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.440
okay so open access journals are free
anybody can read and then

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:32.320
repositories are like the GitHub
repository okay so this is a repository

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:38.720
where we keep all our class material
okay so anyone can use this and it's

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:43.519
open okay then sharing data you can
share your data also not just your

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:48.079
scientific article that you wrote but
you can also share your data so others

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:52.480
can run some analysis and see whether
the analysis that you did is correct or

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:58.480
not okay or if there are any problems
with this data they can also look open

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:03.440
educational resources so you can also
teach about your research you can give a

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:07.839
lecture like make a presentation make a
poster

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:12.240
why is making research openly available
so

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.240
important

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:25.360
institutions institution means like a
university or other research research

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.360
places

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.880
okay did you read all of this mhm

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.320
okay some

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:59.079
stro okay

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:12.279
did you have anything else did you write
any other comments

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:19.920
uh then what else did we learn trying to
force a good grit snake

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:47.880
cheating it's annoying okay sir huh
there was a blue light somewhere it's

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:52.079
nothing to do avoid jargon jargon means
uh it's not style of

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.800
language
jargon special words or expressions that

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:07.679
are used by a
particular profession or group okay so

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:18.720
supposing when you're writing an article
you have to use language that's

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:18.720
understandable by everyone mhm special

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:31.000
words or expressions that are used by a
particular profession or group

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:31.000
profession means job okay uhhuh

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:45.160
it means you need to use simple language
that everyone can understand

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:50.960
think big start broad think big then
narrow

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:56.880
small uh investigate look into the
harinu

00:17:53.240 --> 00:18:01.600
site you might need to site meaning that
so when you're giving the background I

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.440
I'll actually show some articles okay
uh when you're reading the background

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:13.039
when you're uh describing the background
other people have done you actually uh

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:17.200
put a citation to their paper citation
citation is you put a in your references

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:22.480
you have all the papers right let's say
you have 10 references in your you have

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:29.360
10 references at the end 1 2 3 4 they'll
be numbered okay so supposing you say

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:32.360
that uh people have found that the sun
is

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:39.360
uh people have previously found that
the

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:47.520
sunrise and sunset does not happen near
the

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.760
poles okay okay so somebody is near the
south pole or north pole and then they

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:56.480
saw that the sun is just going around in
the sky and not there's no sunset or

00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:01.280
sunrise okay somebody wrote a scientific
paper about it okay and then you're

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:05.679
saying in your background that the some
people people have found that sunrise

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:10.960
and sunset does not happen near the
north pole or the south pole

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:16.240
okay and then you add the number in
brackets you'll add the number to their

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:22.000
paper and your references okay so in
your uh description you have this I'll

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.000
just show you a

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:35.559
paper color i let's take any paper
okay okay let's see my paper maybe a

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:43.760
paper yeah
so let's say some paper okay

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:49.200
so let's go here
this is with some other group okay so

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.160
this is a paper this is this is the
title these are the

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.160
authors okay then if you see this is the
introduction right

00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:01.679
so integrating two or more brain imaging
techniques so this is something this is

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:07.440
saying something about brain techniques
and then it cites these papers this is

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:14.080
one paper this is another paper it says
in this p in these papers this research

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:20.480
was done okay so that's called citing
those

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.480
papers okay then

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:33.000
uh h why what were we discussing
about your paper about the Yeah we were

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:33.000
reading something I think

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:42.240
so that's what it site means udaharinu
so given example uh it's not

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.919
meaning like point

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.120
to

00:20:52.440 --> 00:21:02.240
examples or other work okay they're
pointing so in this paper they have uh

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:02.240
done this research like

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:12.400
that avoid vague terms unclear so we
cannot just say something that's not

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:18.559
very clear to people when they're
reading like an example would be

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:23.320
uh I used

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:36.000
uh a colored
pencil i used a color and mixed it with

00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:40.799
uh uh red color i mixed red color with
another color and I got yellow if I said

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:45.760
that do you know which other color I
mixed no so that's like weighing right

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:51.760
and I say another color i have to say I
mixed red with what green and then got

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:57.840
yellow do we get yellow if you mix red
and green

00:21:53.679 --> 00:22:04.559
um I think so yeah we may get Yeah
depending on how you mix right

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:09.360
uh etc you can use subheadings to
organize different parts of your

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:13.679
procedure plan growth conditions i mean
you can also we talked about different

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:16.240
sections right
just the

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:26.679
facts fact mean like the main things you
just state what you found okay yeah

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.679
there was one more comment
y

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:35.720
dot
okay that's all

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:47.600
so maybe should we separate these
out explain how scientific articles are

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:58.799
published this is called peer review
okay

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.799
then let's make

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:09.240
another okay what are some problems with
reproducibility in scientific research

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:27.200
explain different sections of a
scientific paper in detail and how to

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:27.200
write those

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:33.559
sections okay so we'll make these into
three separate documents

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:46.760
why because you it's easier for you then
so see these headings 1 2 these are like

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:55.280
different steps okay 3 4
5 So let's go here i just copy two three

00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:01.919
so what are the different things that we
were talking uh we were learning about

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:08.960
one is the how scientific articles are
published the review process right

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:13.919
yes then we t learned about
reproducibility in scientific research

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:19.279
and problems
okay

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.279
what are the problems with

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:25.760
reproducibility so let's go

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.120
to So let's rename this

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.039
rename problems
with

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.440
reproducibility in
scientific

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:59.640
research let's see so I'll delete all of
this

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.200
okay problems with

00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:19.120
reproducibility and explain different
sections of the scientific paper in

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:19.120
detail and how to write

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:34.880
this and then okay we have one more
thing what was this how to make research

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:34.880
available openly to

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:44.559
everyone answer the same question in the
language of 10 year

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:48.559
old how much of existing scientific
research is reproducible so problems

00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:54.520
with reproducibility in scientific
research okay so this is the second

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.520
thing

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:02.440
then
here okay I need to copy this one more

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.440
time

00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:14.880
so this is done peer review
process then reproducibility in

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.880
scientific

00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:21.640
research
then okay this is all problems with

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:26.640
reproducibility
right okay this is also still the

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:37.760
same then explain different sections of
a scientific paper in

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:46.799
detail these are the different sections
then once you have your scientific

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.799
research you want

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:58.400
to you want to share it with everyone
make it accessible to everyone right so

00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:06.520
this let's call it how to write
different section how to write a

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:10.600
scientific paper how to write a
scientific

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.600
paper
different

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:29.080
sections okay mhm
then you have to rename this copy to

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.080
which one yeah

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.880
how to write scientific
paper how they're published

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:44.400
reproducibility in research and then the
last one is how to make it openly

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:44.400
accessible to everyone right

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.559
how to
make

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:09.679
scientific

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:17.120
research
available to

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.720
everyone okay mhm

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.679
scientific research available to
everyone so this is

00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:35.600
that
okay

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:40.840
so now what what's the first one among
all of these

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:47.159
how to write a site with
dot i think you have to delete the copy

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:54.320
the first one I think it'll be it'll go
away it'll get updated automatically see

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:59.039
yeah so what's the first one let's
rename

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:59.039
these

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:09.360
uh actually let's do it in the same way
that we did

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:15.760
1 or should we make it zero because this
is always important right outside of the

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:20.720
class also 0.1 is how scientific
articles are published

00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:28.000
mhm
and then we also need to know problems

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:28.000
with reproducibility let's call it

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:36.640
0.2 okay
then how so once you understand these

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:42.919
are the problems we keep that in mind
and then we write our scientific

00:29:38.919 --> 00:29:42.919
papers okay

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:48.159
then this is the No this is

00:29:48.200 --> 00:30:00.159
0.3 right
then once you you also want to make sure

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.159
it's available to everyone

00:30:05.159 --> 00:30:11.960
0.4 okay so today we have to learn a few
more things

00:30:12.679 --> 00:30:25.000
uh where is it over
here actually let's check if all of

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.559
these are shown
correctly explain how scientific

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:34.480
articles are published peer review
process etc okay mhm yeah how to make

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:39.360
research and then I I have to I did not
delete the rest of it in this

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:45.720
what are some problems with reproduce
from here onwards we put it in the other

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.720
documents right

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:56.640
why is peer review important so this is
just the peer review process this is the

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:59.480
first talk one second one is what are
some problems with reproducibility in

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:04.840
scientific
research so I'll give you some exercises

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:11.440
today
okay i answer the same question again in

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:16.159
the language of a 10 year old okay
so this is fine then what's the third

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.440
one how to write explain different
sections of scientific paper in detail

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:25.360
and how to write those sections so if
you want to write a paper this is what

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:30.480
it is the these are the sections that
you will have in your paper a poster is

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:36.360
also kind of similar but for poster you
can organize them in different ways okay

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:41.960
just make it easier for people to
understand then you also want to make

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:49.720
your research openly available to
everyone okay so these are the topics

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.720
that we learned in last class

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:56.000
now sizes types read article now let's

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:05.360
actually it's not enough that you are uh
writing articles right but before you

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.760
even start working on your research you
want to know what others have done what

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:14.000
has already been found out in this topic
right we don't have to do the same thing

00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:17.240
that people already have done several
times before

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:25.480
so
explain how

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:32.679
uh
how a

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:39.240
15year-old could
read

00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:46.679
scientific articles on various
topics that he may or may not

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:54.360
be familiar familiar
with what are the

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.360
examples

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.000
explain step by

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:09.240
step how a scient 15year-old could read
scientific articles on various topics

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.240
that he may or may not be familiar with

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:23.600
let's see what it
says okay so you want to dive into

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.600
finding articles approaching the

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:32.159
article okay okay so you want to dive
into the world of scientific articles so

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:36.080
suppose you want to learn uh you want to
read scientific articles on any topic

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:43.600
right supposing you want to read
scientific articles on maps okay or on

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:48.640
anything else that's awesome so it can
seem a bit intimidating intimidating

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:55.279
means it may feel like it's a difficult
thing okay difficult scary at first but

00:33:52.799 --> 00:34:01.600
here is a step-by-step guide to help you
navigate them navigate means like how

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:05.200
you go uh through this process
even if you're not an expert on the

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:10.159
topic finding articles first you have to
find the articles right start with what

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:14.399
you know and what interests you if you
are curious about black holes black

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:20.560
holes are
uh certain objects in the space okay and

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:25.760
they attract everything inside they suck
everything inside it's like a vacuum

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:31.839
vacuum cleaner sucks everything right
black hole if anything goes near it it

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:37.720
goes inside how it's very uh it's it has
a very strong attraction where is it

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:43.040
they're not close to us they're far
away in space if you're curious about

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:47.040
bell black holes search for scientific
articles black holes or research paper

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:50.560
black holes adding terms like simple
explanation for beginners can sometimes

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:54.960
lead to more accessible articles though
they might be less formal research

00:34:52.159 --> 00:35:00.720
papers use reliable search engines
google Scholar is specifically for

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.200
scientific literature so you use Google
search normally right if you search

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.520
something here it goes to Google search
but there is a website called scholars

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:14.320
scholar means scientific scholar people
who are doing research here if you go

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:16.720
it'll give scientific articles let's say
black

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:26.800
holes whatever okay
uh uh black holes and then these are all

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:31.960
scientific articles on black holes
exploring black holes if you go here

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:40.760
uh this
is they say this is a book i think it's

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:46.880
not a scientific article i think it's a
book i don't

00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:51.160
know oh we clicked on this one right
it's a

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:58.560
book okay and this
is a black a paper on black holes okay

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:05.119
so this is the title these are the
authors this is the abstract and then it

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:10.320
seems I have access maybe it's an
open-source article so everybody can

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:16.160
read this some article they they ask you
to pay or if you have a university login

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.920
if you work at a university if you're a
student in a university you can login

00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:27.000
through the university and then you'll
be able to read so here what do they

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.000
have there's an introduction section

00:36:28.839 --> 00:36:36.640
okay and then here you see so here
they're saying something about black

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:42.000
holes and then they put in brackets two
right so two means the second reference

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:47.440
in their references in the list of
references this is the second one so the

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:53.280
second paper is talking about this topic
so that's this article so if you go here

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:59.400
these are the references this is at the
end so the second one that's what

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:08.079
they're pointing to okay and
then uh they're describing all of this

00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:12.680
then they have other things you can so I
explained about different sections right

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:16.880
sometimes you
have different things okay other

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:25.000
sections where they describe about
different topics or it could be I think

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:29.560
this is more of a theoretical uh
paper they probably

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.440
uh this is more of a theoretical paper
that's also something that we'll learn

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:46.480
today different types of scientific
articles okay here they're not doing any

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:50.160
actual experiments they're not looking
at black holes because they're not black

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:54.640
holes are not near us right yes you
cannot reach them and experiment with

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:58.800
them
so but they can do other things

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:05.599
mathematical analysis and all they can
do okay so can they go in space and then

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:11.119
throw a they can get a rock at the No
it's not near we It's

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:15.280
not at a point where we can reach
they're so far away it'll take like

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:21.680
thousands millions of years to go
millions billions of years to go

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:27.359
there even if you go in a rocket they're
that far away okay a solar system and

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:31.839
then at the end they have it's not just
solar system right it's not in solar

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:38.400
system it's away from solar system it's
in other galaxies and I mean it's in

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:44.960
other planet
it's in the galaxy like Milky Way galaxy

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:51.839
i think it'll have a black hole
it's a vir how do I know where is it

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:56.240
it's it's some somewhere far away that
we cannot

00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:01.040
reach okay so these are the diff
different things so that's how you

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:05.599
search for a scientific article and then
look for open access articles as we

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:09.119
talked about these are free to read when
you search on Google Scholar you might

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:14.640
see a PDF link on the right which often
means it's open access explore reputable

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:19.119
science news websites like science
sometimes uh some of these scientific

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:23.440
articles for example this article is not
so easy for you to understand right

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:29.200
there are equations and all these things
that you don't know but what you can do

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:34.599
is sometimes people write a a news
article about this research when it's a

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:39.800
news article it's written
for normal people to read and understand

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:45.119
so you can look
for science news

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:48.720
websites and they often summarize recent
scientific articles in a more

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:54.960
understandable way and usually provide a
link to the original paper if you want

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:57.920
to dig deeper okay so uh approaching the
article don't try to understand

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.960
everything at once when you're reading
an article for example if I have to read

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:09.280
this article I have no idea about black
holes what will I try to do first i'll

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:13.520
try and read this title what's a black
hole you don't know what a black hole is

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:18.480
right just look up what a black hole
means search Google for black hole black

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:23.440
holes are regions in space with such
strong gravity that nothing not even

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:28.240
light can escape them so anything that
goes near it gets absorbed that's what

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:35.440
you understand that part you're able to
understand right in simple way fuz

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:42.720
proposal what's a fuzball
a ball of fuzz what's fuzz fluffy or

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:52.240
frizzy mass of hair or fiber okay so a
fuzz ball is like a ball of

00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:52.240
hair right search Google for

00:40:52.359 --> 00:41:01.839
fuzball images
it's kind of like this I think see if

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:07.920
you have a bunch of hair and it's uh put
together like a ball it looks like this

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:15.440
right yes so they're saying a fuzball
proposal proposal means like a plan

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:21.680
like So they're saying a black hole
could be like a fuzz

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:27.040
ball maybe it's not like an actual ball
it's like a fuzz ball like a hairy that

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:32.880
ball that we just saw maybe it's like
this I think that's what this paper is

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:37.760
proposing proposing means they're saying
uh they're coming up with a new idea so

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:43.359
that's what it's saying okay so first we
have to understand the

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:48.800
title start with the title and abstract
that's the most important thing so I I

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:53.200
try to understand the title right next
I'll try to understand the whole of the

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:57.520
abstract this is the main research arch
right this is the main summary of their

00:41:55.119 --> 00:42:04.800
research I'll read this I'll try to
understand every single thing in this in

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:08.800
a way that's simple okay and then and
then I'll decide whether I want to read

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:13.520
the actual research or methods and all
of this okay if this does not interest

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:20.640
me I don't have to read the rest of the
article right so title is very important

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:27.119
to understand it and same with abstract
try to understand the whole of The

00:42:24.599 --> 00:42:30.960
abstract these are your road map the
title tells you the main topic and the

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:35.520
abstract gives you a quick summary of
the research questions methods key

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:41.599
findings and conclusions abstract gives
you a quick summary of all of this right

00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:44.800
read these carefully to see if the
article is relevant to what you're

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:49.280
interested in and if it seems
understandable enough to tackle so we

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:54.800
have to read these carefully to see
whether this is what we want to learn

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.760
okay and whether it uh whether it's
something you'll be able to

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:11.040
understand so then read the
introduction so the introduction is also

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:16.720
very important why introduction gives
you a background about everything right

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:21.599
a background about black black holes and
everything that's known so far so let's

00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:26.800
see the physics of black holes has been
at the center stage of theoretical

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:32.079
physics for over 30 years as black holes
this was in which year so this was

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:36.760
published in so here it says which year
it was published in 2008 yeah october

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:43.680
okay so that's
almost how many years 17 years ago okay

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:48.319
so then they're saying it has been so
for almost 30 years people have been

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:55.599
studying black holes and other thing
like in detail so 30 + 17 now right as

00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:00.240
black holes raise puzzles that directly
challenge many cherished fundamental

00:43:57.599 --> 00:44:04.960
physical properties such as unitarity
and locality i don't know what these

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.640
mean okay and this is all part of
physics

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:14.440
defining questions in this area have
been why does a black hole have entropy

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:20.720
proportional to its hor horizon
area you don't know what this means

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:25.040
right entropy horizon
proportional proportional you don't know

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:30.960
what this means is there information
lost because of black holes how does one

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:35.160
resolve space-time singularity
so if we are talking because this is

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:39.280
physics and more complicated maths
involved those type of articles are more

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:43.960
difficult to read unless you know that
mathematics for example if I'm talking

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:48.960
about
uh powers of numbers and prime numbers

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:54.440
and other things how you can use uh
certain properties of prime

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:58.240
numbers to create
passwords unless you know prime number

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.960
you'll not be able to understand
anything else right yeah so that's why

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:07.280
mathemat Mathemat papers on mathematics
papers that use a lot of mathematics are

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:13.839
difficult to understand whereas papers
on biology for example are somewhat

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:18.720
easier to follow once you understand
like how the articles are generally

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:24.839
organized because for example if I say
amigdala you don't know what that means

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:29.839
right but if you just look up
amigdala it says amydala is a small

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:34.800
almond shaped structure inside your
brain it's easy to understand right it's

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:39.280
a small part of the brain it's part of a
larger network in your brain called the

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:43.920
lyic system okay it's a part of the
brain called lyic system and amydala is

00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:47.200
inside this part when it comes to your
survival your amigdala and lyic system

00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:52.040
are extremely important they're very
important for us to survive for us to

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:56.280
live yes these automatically detect
danger do you understand this they

00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:00.560
detect
danger danger means like for example you

00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:06.000
are an animal you're living in the
forest and suddenly you smell a tiger

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:13.280
animals have like many animals have good
sense of smell you smell a tiger or you

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:18.599
hear the uh roar of a tiger then
amigdala immediately responds to that

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:25.920
it immediately
recognizes that that the that the roar

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:30.480
is that of a tiger okay and then you run
away right otherwise you'll be dead

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:35.359
right so that's the part that's
controlling

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:39.839
uh this behavior okay so it's protecting
you from danger it senses when there is

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:45.280
danger are you able to understand this
yes right this uh so these kind of

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:50.480
things are easier to understand whereas
when it's uh when there's lot of

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:54.560
mathematics it's not always easy to
understand

00:46:52.599 --> 00:47:00.240
okay
so for example

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:05.440
uh when I was in my PhD my background
was not in biology okay I did not know I

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:10.640
did not study biology before that before
joining PhD biology biology mean like

00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:16.800
about body parts brain all these I
studied more mathematical things more

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:23.280
more like phys computers and then some
mathematics also

00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:26.880
okay so in our classes for neuroscience
We

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:30.960
had some most of the topics were biology
related but I was able to follow I could

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:34.839
just look up about different parts of
the brain but when there was research

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:40.400
about
uh when there was research relate that's

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:44.160
more mathematical I could follow because
I knew the

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:47.920
mathematics but there are people who
only studied biology before for them

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:53.680
it'll be difficult to follow the
mathematics part of it right

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:58.720
so I mean there are like pros and cons
but in general like mathematical papers

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:03.640
are more difficult to follow unless you
know the mathematics others like for

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:10.000
example if you people are talking about
history you can read it right we may not

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:15.079
know that part but it may be generally
somewhat easier to

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:19.200
follow
okay read this carefully to see if the

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.880
article is relevant okay then the
introduction gives you some background

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:26.800
on the topic it should also state the
specific question the scientists were

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:31.200
trying to answer or their hypothesis so
introduction gives you a background and

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.800
then it also tells you what they are
trying to answer their question right

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:39.800
and what's the hypothesis that they are
going to test this can help you get to

00:48:37.839 --> 00:48:44.640
get a better grasp of the
context then skip to the conclusion if

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:49.520
the methods and results sections look
too technical at first jump to the

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:54.599
conclusion what they're saying is go to
the conclusion and then uh see again

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:59.440
there is the main summary right main
findings so this section usually

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.880
summarize the main findings in a more
accessible way and discusses their

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.920
implication and what are the main
findings and what does it mean like the

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:11.200
meth uh discussion part understanding
the conclusion first can give you a

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:16.880
framework for going back to the more
detailed parts then tackling the tricky

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:21.920
parts methods and results are usually
the difficult part to

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.559
follow don't get bogged down in every
detail of the methods you don't need to

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:31.280
understand every single part of the
methods for example I I mean here they

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:36.160
don't have a separate section saying
methods but it's essentially it's more

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:41.839
like a theoretical paper so these are
the methods some methods that they're

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.839
using holographic methods

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:50.480
generalities I don't know what else two
charge system so they're describing all

00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:57.440
the mathematics of black holes I guess
and their theory and fuz balls and black

00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:02.160
hole physics here they're describing why
they think it's fuzz balls and then

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:07.359
these are the conclusions so what will
we try if I have to read this paper I'll

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:12.000
try can read the title title I think we
understood right but abstract I don't

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:17.520
really uh we haven't even looked at it
we don't understand introduction

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:21.599
also I may be able to understand if I
read some of this okay i may have to

00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:29.839
look up a few things but I'll probably
be able to understand

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:33.839
uh at least a general idea okay
but methods most likely I'll not

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:37.920
understand because I don't know what
what's going on here what type of

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:42.240
mathematics and everything but
conclusions will probably be able to

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.880
understand i'll probably be able to
understand

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:53.520
okay
see I have been uh studying for a lot of

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:58.000
time right I'll also not understand a
lot of papers so that's what I wanted to

00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:03.040
show that when you look at a paper it's
okay if you don't understand

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:08.640
anything okay but we will try break it
down into

00:51:04.599 --> 00:51:15.319
simple things and
uh try and understand like at least the

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:20.880
main part main findings of that
paper pay attention okay so don't get

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:24.319
bogged down in every detail of the
methods it means that you don't have to

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.240
try and understand every part of the
methods it's okay if you don't

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:33.920
understand pay attention to figures and
tables in the results this is the main

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:37.599
thing so in this paper for example they
don't have any figures and tables right

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:41.599
usually that's what happens when it's a
mathematical

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:46.000
paper that's why it becomes more
difficult to understand also it's all

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:51.520
equations so you cannot understand but
let's see another

00:51:47.559 --> 00:51:58.280
paper okay I'll show you another paper
uh let's what topic let's talk about

00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:02.640
amigdala
amigdala emotion

00:52:04.119 --> 00:52:09.000
okay this is some paper

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:18.559
uh so here you see uh I have the they
have the title and then there is the

00:52:16.119 --> 00:52:21.920
abstract and then this is a review
article there are different typ types of

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:27.599
articles that's something that we have
to learn today okay

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:31.359
what does review article i'll explain
i'll explain when we learn the types of

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:39.800
articles so for that paper I think it's
a paid article see it's a paid

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:45.440
article
uh so I don't have access to it they

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:53.680
only show the title and abstract so if I
pay for it then I can read the article

00:52:50.880 --> 00:53:01.839
i'll start from there
but yeah so this this is ah here this is

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:06.720
open access okay so that's why I can
read even without logging in so this is

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:13.839
the title amigdala and emotion emotion
what is emotion like fear happiness all

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:19.680
of these are emotions right yes
so they're saying they're talking about

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.680
the relation between amydala and emotion

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:26.960
And then so I'll try and understand the
abstract the amygdala complex has long

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:33.359
been known as part of the neural
circuitry critical for emotion do you

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:38.960
understand this for a long time they
thought that amygdala amydala complex

00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:43.240
mean like the part amigdala
uh is part of neural means like related

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:48.160
to brain like brain cells are called
neurons okay this is the neural

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.839
circuitry critical for emotion so
they're saying for a long time people

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:58.240
knew that
amydala is important for emotion okay so

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:02.319
you can understand this part right and
like that you will be able to understand

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:04.599
you just have to look up a few words
that you don't know you'll be able to

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:10.559
understand these
articles and

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:16.800
then let's see so this is the actual
article do they have any images they do

00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:22.960
there are some images not much again
this is not so useful for what I was

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.960
trying to

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:30.079
explain brain

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.240
research or let's say rocket

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:44.599
research liquid propellant rocket this
is a

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:48.079
review rocket solid propellant rocket
research this is a

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:54.599
textbook fundamental problems in rocket
research

00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:04.960
rocket propulsion
components okay so so do we okay there

00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:09.599
are several images in this paper right
so in this paper what I'll do is I'll

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:14.160
read the title i'll read the abstract
and understand and then decide whether I

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:17.839
want to read this article and then if I
want to then I'll read the introduction

00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:25.040
introduction points to all the previous
research that was done right then I'll

00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:29.359
go directly into these images just go to
this image they're explaining something

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:33.760
and then usually results are all
explained in these tables and images so

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:36.800
just read the table what does it explain
and then there is a caption for the

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:42.119
table this called caption this is
explaining what the table is showing

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:46.119
uh-huh and same for this table there's a
caption okay

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:53.040
these are all And then there is
something else

00:55:50.079 --> 00:56:01.520
and for figure two schematic of a simple
neuron model they're using a neuron

00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:01.520
model for uh something

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:08.440
okay and then you read
this just try to understand the figures

00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:15.160
that's how you
understand a paper okay

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:19.839
let's go
back don't pay attention to figures and

00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:24.960
tables in the results so when you're
trying to understand the results don't

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:30.000
read through the whole section first
just try and understand the figures and

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:34.160
tables first then read the text in the
results section selectively then if you

00:56:32.319 --> 00:56:38.240
want whichever you don't understand or
you want to understand in more detail

00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:42.799
you read that in more detail
understanding the discussion this is

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:47.760
where things start to come together in
discussion the scientists explain what

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:51.920
their results mean okay focus on the
main interpretations what are the key

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:55.200
takeaways from their research look for
limitations and future directions

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.520
usually in the paper itself sometimes
you mention what are some problems that

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:05.440
you face during this research what are
some additional research

00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:09.880
uh what is some research that you can do
later on to extend this research in

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:16.160
future
okay limitation means like uh for

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:20.640
example we cannot travel to every part
of the world right if we are looking at

00:57:18.319 --> 00:57:25.520
sunrise and sunset we are studying we
can only do it from here or maybe we can

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:28.799
travel like a few miles around our house
but we cannot travel to every country in

00:57:27.119 --> 00:57:32.880
the world and then see we cannot travel
to North Pole and South Pole and then

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:38.720
see what happens there right so those
are limitations of our study

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:42.799
building your own your understanding
over time don't expect to understand

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:46.799
everything perfectly on the first read
when you first read something you won't

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:52.000
be able to understand everything but at
least try to understand the title and

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:57.119
abstract and then introduction okay look
up unfamiliar words and concepts when

00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:02.400
there is some word that you don't know
look up look up means like uh find out

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:06.559
its meaning read multiple articles on
the same topic on the same topic you

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:10.960
have to read different
uh papers talk about it you can also

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:16.359
talk about your research to others be
patient and persistent you have to be

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:21.040
patient patient
is uh don't give up just because you

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:25.520
don't understand i'm saying like I don't
understand this but if I have to

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:28.720
understand I'll spend a lot of time and
I'll try and understand all the ma i

00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:31.839
don't know this mathematics okay there
are several different kinds of

00:58:30.319 --> 00:58:37.599
mathematics
the two charge super symmetric d1 d5

00:58:34.319 --> 00:58:41.680
super gravity solution is d s² dt²
whatever I don't understand anything in

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:50.480
this but if I have to understand I'll
sit I'll carefully try and

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:54.720
uh uh learn everything about it okay
in short when tackling a scientific

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:59.920
article find a relevant article through
reliable sources start with the title

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:04.400
and abstract to get the main idea read
the introduction for background jump to

00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:07.720
the conclusion for the key takeaways
right introduction gives you background

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:12.640
conclusion will give you the main
findings focus on the visuals and main

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:18.400
points in the results for results just
look at the figures what do you do first

00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:22.640
understand the title and abstract then
read the introduction then read the

00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:27.839
conclusions what did they find out maybe
then just look at the figures okay that

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:33.200
makes it easier so it's much simpler
than reading the whole paper right

00:59:30.799 --> 00:59:38.880
carefully read I mean the reason I'm
explaining all of this to you is when

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:42.880
you write a paper also you'll need to
follow the same thing so somebody else

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:48.760
reading your paper will read the
abstract first title first then abstract

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:53.359
okay then the conclusions and then
introduction okay so these are the main

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:57.440
things and then your main results you
need to convey in your

00:59:55.160 --> 01:00:04.000
images and then you'll have a lot of
description in the text but that's

01:00:01.559 --> 01:00:07.119
okay jump to the conclusions focus on
the visuals and main points in the

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.280
results carefully read the discussion to
understand the interpretation look up

01:00:08.559 --> 01:00:14.880
unfamiliar terms and don't be afraid to
reread reread means you you can read

01:00:12.799 --> 01:00:18.960
again and again read more articles on
the same topic over time you have got

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.160
this it's like learning a new language
it might seem tough at first but with

01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:28.240
practice you'll become fluent in reading
the fascinating stories that science

01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:33.680
tells okay uh-huh this is a very
important

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:39.599
topic now actually we'll do some
examples okay so it mentioned to read

01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:45.160
news articles on that scientific
research right yes but now we don't need

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:51.000
news articles because AI has
developed so much it can summarize the

01:00:48.799 --> 01:00:56.079
scientific article in a way that we
understand right we'll actually do that

01:00:53.520 --> 01:01:01.599
for these papers
okay

01:00:57.559 --> 01:01:08.240
mhm are we in the last version which
version can we go to another version

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:12.119
another proof version for this I think
that's I mean it's okay it keeps

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:18.720
changing it doesn't
matter so we have to make

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.720
another

01:01:20.119 --> 01:01:25.640
article so I just copy this maybe

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.040
so from

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:49.680
here can read this it's it may sound
difficult okay but it won't be that

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:54.960
difficult once we uh get familiar with
this okay initially it may look does it

01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:01.160
feel it's difficult or are you okay are
you able to follow what I'm saying um

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:06.960
about the no about like scientific
articles it may be a bit difficult but

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.160
right now we are not understanding any
article right I'm just saying what are

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:16.480
the different sections in an article and
how to read it right I'm not asking you

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.480
to read an article

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.599
right
this and

01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:37.799
Okay okay

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:46.960
explain step by
step how you could read scientific

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:51.160
articles on various
sir are there any book

01:02:52.960 --> 01:03:00.480
um everything is good okay so how to
read scientific

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:11.480
articles I mean the number may not
really make sense it's okay okay Okay I

01:03:07.359 --> 01:03:11.480
think can keep two

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.640
scientific articles

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:29.760
this number actually doesn't make sense
no it the reason I'm putting zero point

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:35.640
is so that they'll all be at first and
they're not related to one particular

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:42.280
class right they'll always be useful
so this part you understood right mhm

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:47.119
the next part
is what are the types of scientific

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:57.839
articles let's go here
what are the

01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:57.839
different

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:08.280
types
of

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.280
scientific articles

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.640
explain 15 year old yeah that

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:19.039
explain 50 year

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.760
old
like review

01:04:26.119 --> 01:04:34.400
articles okay
what are the different types

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:47.680
of scientific research and types of
scientific research and types of

01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:53.720
scientific articles
okay there are different types like

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.720
review articles

01:04:57.799 --> 01:05:01.799
uh theoretical

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:27.640
theoretical mathematical I mean that's
also theoretical

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.640
uh or you could have
comput

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.920
computational

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:39.960
modeling experimental

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.440
etc

01:05:47.079 --> 01:05:54.079
okay let's break down the different ways
scientists do research and the different

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.839
kind of articles they write to share
their findings all in a way that makes

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:01.920
sense for a 15year-old types of
scientific research different ways to

01:05:59.799 --> 01:06:05.440
investigate imagine scientists as
detectives trying to solve mysteries

01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:12.319
about the world they use different tools
and approaches okay so this is about

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:15.440
scientific research
okay this is good i

01:06:16.119 --> 01:06:24.079
think theoretical research brainstorming
and building ideas what is it this is

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:27.599
like sitting down and thinking deeply
about how things work theoretical

01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:31.920
scientists develop new ideas concepts
and explanations about the world often

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:36.960
using logic and existing knowledge
theoretical research is when you are not

01:06:34.559 --> 01:06:43.480
doing any actual experiments okay we are
just sitting here and like thinking

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:50.079
about it and just coming up with good
ideas okay and then you can uh use some

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:54.400
logical explanations like you learned
about logic where did you learn like

01:06:51.760 --> 01:07:00.000
boolean logic right if this is correct
that has to be correct if this is wrong

01:06:57.039 --> 01:07:05.280
that is wrong those kind of logic okay
uh-huh that's theoretical research

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:08.640
mathematical research this uses
mathematical principles and tech

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:14.319
techniques to explore relationships
patterns and structures so for

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:21.839
example we learned about ma
multiplication right how you multiply

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:26.799
three-digit numbers okay we learned that
but then I also explained to you using

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:32.440
the properties of numbers why this
process works yes right associative law

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:38.039
that's like more mathematical
understanding of this technique okay

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:42.960
mathematical research is usually like
that okay

01:07:40.559 --> 01:07:47.160
yes it can be used to describe and
predict how things behave in the real

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:54.240
world or to explore abstract
concepts abstract

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:58.559
means like ideas uh-huh
example developing developing new

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:04.000
statistical methods to analyze large
data sets if you have a large data set

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:10.240
statistical methods means
uh like there's a kind of mathematics

01:08:07.319 --> 01:08:15.839
okay to analyze a large data set you
have a huge data like millions and

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:24.000
billions of
uh data that you collected how can it be

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:31.040
possible it can be possible when how
think about the data so let's say I'm I

01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:37.560
have this mouse pointer right huh and at
every second it's at a different point

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:45.759
right yes so at every for each
second I can find out where it is on the

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:51.040
screen right so that's my data point
right and so how much how much data will

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:57.359
I get in 1 hour
um so 60 minutes time 60 seconds 3600

01:08:54.719 --> 01:09:01.600
data points in 1 hour i'm doing this
every day so I'll collect this every day

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.679
and then I can collect it not just on
this computer from like there are so

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:09.759
many computers like millions of
computers around the world i can collect

01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:16.239
the data from all of them so million
times 3600 times let's say 5 hours a day

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:20.319
times 5 times let's say we collected it
for 1 year 1

01:09:17.799 --> 01:09:26.799
year okay so do you think something like
this is possible yes people do like

01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:31.679
Google search I you see how many times I
am using Google search or AI right yeah

01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:35.440
so but how many people are actually
using it like there are billions of

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:41.359
people who are using this and they're
using it every day at right so many

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:47.440
times every day so you get they get
billions of uh data points every day

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:52.880
right so it happens and you if you want
to analyze that amount of

01:09:49.159 --> 01:09:57.920
data you need certain techniques right
if we just use Python to use that

01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:04.239
process that it'll take forever if we
use like in our computer okay how huh

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:10.000
because it's it's a lot of data right it
takes some time to compute uh-huh it

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:15.679
computer is still faster than us
but still it takes time can a can the

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:20.000
calculator take that time yeah
calculator is even slower so then you

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:24.400
have to use like hundreds and thousands
of computers to do this to do the

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:29.520
computations okay so the next one is
computational research using computers

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:35.440
to simulate and analyze this is the same
thing that we doing in Python we are

01:10:31.679 --> 01:10:40.159
simulating things modeling things right
like propeller a toy propeller we have

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:47.360
modeled a toy propeller we have model
modeled uh piano right so if you give

01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:51.320
the notes it plays the piano notes so
that kind of research is called

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:57.120
computational
research then modeling research creates

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.880
simplified representations if scientists
build models to represent real world

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:06.320
phenomena these models simplify complex
systems to understand

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:10.000
uh to help us understand them better
building a miniature airplane to test

01:11:08.239 --> 01:11:14.480
its aerodynamics so instead of building
a huge

01:11:11.159 --> 01:11:18.880
airplane you can build a small one and
see whether it's working all the the

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:26.239
shape of the airplane and all these
things whether they make sense right you

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:30.800
first use a small model and then make it
work then you build the bigger thing

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.560
that's called modeling research
experimental research hands-on

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.960
investigation this is what you probably
think of as a typical science experiment

01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:41.679
normally when you think of science
experiment this is what it is

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:46.320
experimental research right you're
actually doing the experiments

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:52.159
collecting data and then doing and then
analyzing it observational research

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:56.159
watching and recording so sometimes
you're not doing any experiments but

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.760
you're just observing like when you if
you want to study sun we are not making

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.120
any changes to the sun or the earth
right you're just observing right for

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:10.600
black holes also you just observe what's
happening how they're rotating those

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:15.920
kind of things using a
telescope that's obser observational

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:21.159
research qualitative research exploring
experiences and meanings

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:27.360
supposing uh I ask 100
people like how many hours uh uh like

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:32.880
for each person I ask how many hours
they slept on a particular day and then

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:38.000
I asked them uh whether they were
feeling more joyful that day or were

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:44.159
they sad were they angry those kind of
things okay i asked each person I asked

01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:50.159
the same question like every day for an
year and I ask the same question

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:55.840
uh to 100 different people okay so this
is qualitative research so we are uh

01:12:53.280 --> 01:13:01.280
finding certain uh details from people
through surveys this is called a survey

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:05.600
okay and then we'll find out right where
if we get this data then we can see if

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:12.480
people are sleeping more are they
becoming more angry or are they becoming

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:19.360
more uh peaceful like how much amount of
time if they sleep are is it good for

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:24.159
them yes okay so quantitative research
measuring and analyzing numbers so here

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:29.679
you're just asking them
uh whether they

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:35.640
slept a long longer than usual or less
than usual here you'll ask them actual

01:13:32.719 --> 01:13:42.800
numbers how many hours did you sleep
quantitative quantity means how much

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:48.320
right numbers qualitative means like
whether it was good or bad whether they

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.040
uh they thought their sleep was bad that
day or good

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:59.840
quantitative research is when you ask
them how long this slept okay mhm

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:04.320
so these are the different types of
scientific research did you understand

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.320
this part

01:14:08.199 --> 01:14:12.480
now types of scientific

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.440
articles okay what are the different
types of scientific articles so these

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:26.159
are the different types of research
right you know a few of these

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.679
experimental research you understand you
colle you do some experiments you

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:34.719
collect data modeling research you
understand that right

01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:41.199
you create a model of a toy propeller
and then you do some experiments on that

01:14:37.159 --> 01:14:46.000
model so then these are types of
scientific articles original research

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:50.159
article or a research paper this is the
most common type of article this

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:55.199
describes a new study that the
scientists themselves conducted so if we

01:14:52.080 --> 01:15:00.080
conducted a new modeling study or a new
experimental study and then we uh

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:05.719
describe our methods our results
everything that's called an original

01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:13.040
research article or research
paper review article review article

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:17.440
means so in our article we are writing
in the introduction all the research

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:23.360
that pre uh people have done before
right so review articles are usually

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:29.199
like that introduction section okay so
the whole article it's a big

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.880
introduction section of this of uh
another article okay so it's describing

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:38.880
all the research that's done on black
holes for

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:42.960
example let's say so a review article
will not have methods and all of these

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:47.239
things conclusions i mean they will have
conclusions or other things but main

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.560
findings main
summary black

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:59.920
holes review black holes in astrophysics
this was written in 2005 like 20 years

01:16:00.199 --> 01:16:09.040
ago sometimes they ask this to just make
to tap every object that rotates like

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:12.679
the one in the sample rotate rotate this
doesn't this doesn't

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.159
okay black holes in

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:27.280
articles what is
it article

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:35.920
PDF again this also has a title this
also has a an abstract this paper

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:42.880
reviews the current article so it's like
a review of all the research that's

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:47.440
existing on that topic okay so they have
introduction basic concepts measuring BH

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:53.440
mass so these are all from different
studies they put together all the

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.440
details kind of like a textbook you

01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:02.159
know instead of presenting new research
a review article looks back at a lot of

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.640
existing research on a specific topic
and summarizes what has already been

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.640
found

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:20.080
did you understand huh did you
understand what's a review article

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:23.120
um review article
review article

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:35.280
means like to just
explain the main findings main findings

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:39.520
of whose research their research yeah no
of other research so when you're writing

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.159
a review article supposing you have to
write a review article on

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:51.520
uh phonetics so you'll just see what
other people have done on phonetics and

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:57.840
then describe everything as a summary
like a textbook okay you're not doing

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:03.199
any new research there so that's what a
review article is and systematic review

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:06.840
and meta analysis
these are types of review articles but

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:11.600
even more
rigorous so they'll find some uh analyze

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.320
all the relevant studies and meta
analysis goes a step further use

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:18.679
statistical techniques to combine the
results so review article just describes

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:23.760
the results of
others systematic review and meta

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:28.480
analysis what they do is they collect
the data from these other studies and

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:33.360
they do some more analysis okay they're
not doing more

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.320
experiments methodology paper
methodology paper

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:46.960
means methodology paper means it's
describing some new methods supposing

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:51.040
you're not collecting any new data but
you are finding a new method to analyze

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:57.199
this kind of data you're creating a new
method new analysis method okay analysis

01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:02.120
means like you have lots of data right
you can analyze it in different ways

01:19:03.679 --> 01:19:10.640
so
that's it or you can develop a new

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:15.920
machine to get the data so people are
getting data from human brains and using

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:22.679
some machine supposing you develop a new
machine that gives uh uh better data

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:27.440
okay that's that will be a methodology
paper

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:30.719
okay short communication or letter these
are shorter articles that present

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:36.080
important findings that need to be
shared okay these are like shorter

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:41.679
articles these are not full-fledged like
long papers like very short case

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:46.320
study this type of article provides a
detailed analysis of a specific case

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:51.920
like a unique patient normally you
collect data from many people right many

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:56.640
subjects but supposing we have only one
person with a

01:19:53.960 --> 01:20:01.760
disease you won't be able to get that
data from 100 people 100 people don't

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:09.239
have that disease it's a new disease so
you write about that one person that's

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:16.000
called a case study there's one case
okay opinion or perspective it's usually

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:21.120
like uh again this is more like theory
there's no experiment or anything you're

01:20:18.719 --> 01:20:25.520
just expressing your opinion maybe we
should do it this way then it'll be

01:20:22.719 --> 01:20:28.960
better those kind of things mhm usually
written by experts in a field who share

01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:36.000
their opinion perspective or commentary
on recent on some recent topics okay did

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.000
you understand this

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.840
what are the different types of

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:47.960
scientific articles

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:04.199
then
0.6 types of scientific artic types of

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:09.280
scientific research and scientific
articles types of scientific

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:18.000
research and articles
okay so what was our question

01:21:24.199 --> 01:21:28.199
this no

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:46.000
I have to understand it all of these
um if I read more detail I might

01:21:44.159 --> 01:21:50.239
understand
did you understand the previous ones

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:54.880
these four articles did you understand 1
2 3 4 this is from last time right yes

01:21:52.800 --> 01:22:00.159
if you understood those then you'll be
able to understand these also okay there

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:06.679
are only two more articles today two
more uh documents today okay huh so now

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:14.159
uh we have to actually read some
articles okay so let's actually read

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:29.360
these summarize this article for a
15year-old

01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:41.360
uh okay so let's

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:50.320
see summarize this
article per 15y

01:22:53.400 --> 01:23:01.920
old okay so this scientific article is
about something called the placebo

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:04.080
effect in pain clinical trials it got
some

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:09.199
other did not get anything

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:17.440
about it's not about black
holes

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:29.400
okay see these are the mistakes that it
makes other things are useful yes so the

01:23:25.679 --> 01:23:33.960
reason I don't want you to use AI is
because you need to know for example all

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:40.800
of these things I kind of know it's just
easier if it writes it down as an

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:44.840
article so you can read it later on
why did this

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:52.560
summarize this

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.639
article 15 year old

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:24.480
all right imagine black holes those
super dense objects in space that suck

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:29.080
everything in even light for a long time
scientists thought of them as having a

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:34.880
single point in the very center called a
singularity okay for a long time people

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:42.000
thought that it's a single point
it's very massive but they thought it's

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:45.840
just one point like one tiny point okay
this singular singularity was weird

01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:49.840
because our current laws of physics
break down there there are laws of

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:56.159
physics right there are different uh
rules that we have learned so

01:24:52.760 --> 01:25:01.199
far but those do not seem to work very
well for those black holes

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:06.800
now this article talks about a different
idea called the fuzball proposal for

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:12.000
what black holes might actually be like
so they're saying instead of a single

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:16.000
point it's like a fuzz ball we learned
what a fuzz ball was right it's like

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.600
very big
fuzz ball is like hairy thing it's not

01:25:18.639 --> 01:25:25.760
one point like if you have all the hair
in one point like one tiny mass that

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:31.520
would be how people thought black holes
were but this article says it's not like

01:25:28.159 --> 01:25:37.000
one that tiny point it's more like a
spread out like more dense at the center

01:25:34.159 --> 01:25:41.760
and outside there is less
hair instead of a tiny point the fuzz

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:48.480
ball proposal suggests that a black hole
is more like a tangled fuzzy ball of

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:54.639
strings think of it like old idea is a
black hole is like a drain in your sink

01:25:52.159 --> 01:25:58.639
everything just goes down to a single
infinitely small point what happens

01:25:56.719 --> 01:26:03.360
there we don't really know it's like one
point where everything's going but going

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:08.639
inside what happens we don't know what's
happening after that yes now fuzzball a

01:26:06.639 --> 01:26:14.400
black hole is more like a giant super
compact hair ball made of incredibly

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:18.159
tiny vibrating strings these strings are
fundamental idea and string theory a

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:22.719
theory that explains everything uh in
the universe

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:28.560
okay so they're saying it's like a fuzz
ball with tiny strings like hair

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:32.960
right with strings here is the breakdown
of the main idea are you able to

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:37.600
understand this now i think right this
is easier to understand right usually

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:42.639
news articles on that research would
describe things like this but now we

01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:47.840
don't really need news articles you can
just use AI to summarize those articles

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.560
okay here is the breakdown of the main
ideas no singularity the fuzzball

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.800
proposal gets rid of the problematic
singularity at the center quantum

01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.239
mechanics included the usual picture of
a black hole comes from Einstein's

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:04.880
theory of gravity this is somebody's
theory okay some famous scientist made a

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:08.480
theory the fuzball idea tries to bring
in the rules of quantum mechanics which

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:14.400
might be important at the extreme
conditions of a black

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:19.840
hole so it's using some other theory to
explain this okay you don't need to

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:26.480
understand every detail just get a sense
so some black uh the old theory was

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:31.080
explaining using this theory the new
theory is you're bringing in some other

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:35.679
theory okay that's all you have to
understand information paradox solve one

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.520
of the big mysteries about black hole is
the information paradox if everything

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.440
falls into a black hole and disappears
into singularity what happens to all the

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:47.440
information about it
quantum mechanics says information

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:51.679
cannot just vanish so quantum this is
some other theory in physics okay it

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:57.280
says that the information about any
object it cannot be

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:01.199
destroyed okay so for example there is
information about the shape of our body

01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:05.520
there is other things right that
information even though we are I I think

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:11.800
I don't understand properly what will
happen if we go into the black hole

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:16.880
that's what it says in the
old theory if it's a if it goes into

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.800
singularity singularity means like one
point the old

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.639
theory in that case the information is
also going away they don't know what's

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:28.000
happening to the
information but in the fuzball proposal

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.840
the information might be stored in the
structure of the fuzz ball itself

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:37.199
they're saying even though this object
is going into the black hole it's

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:42.480
creating more fuzziness in that fuzz
ball and that fuzziness will have the

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:48.320
information this extra information did
you understand no so earlier they said

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:53.040
it's a point right yes i think quantum
mechanics says information cannot be

01:28:50.639 --> 01:28:57.920
destroyed something like that okay i am
not accurate my I have no knowledge of

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:02.239
this i'm just trying to understand okay
but if it's going into a point so

01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:07.520
supposing we I'm walking near the black
hole i go inside i am sucked into that

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:11.840
black hole now in that point where is
this information my information all this

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.920
the shape of my body everything that is
in my brain all of this where did that

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:20.560
information go we don't know right we
cannot explain it first of all nobody's

01:29:18.719 --> 01:29:25.120
going into a black hole so we are
sitting here and this is all like

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:30.679
theoretical research right but the
fuzball rearch fuzzball theory says that

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:36.400
if I go inside this black
hole even though I am getting sucked in

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:43.679
and I am destroyed the information about
me is getting stored in that first ball

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:50.639
it's creating more hairs more details
okay so more powers more hair uh like

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:55.840
that we thought of it as a ball of hair
right it's creating more hair uh

01:29:53.520 --> 01:30:01.520
fragments and creating more information
that all that information from me it's

01:29:58.239 --> 01:30:07.320
creating in another form okay are you
able to understand this yes right i also

01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:11.880
understand whatever you are you
understand so it's solving some other

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:16.960
problem with the old
theory different from empty space unlike

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:21.800
the empty space around it the inside of
a black hole would be very complex and

01:30:19.199 --> 01:30:26.800
active place made of these vibrating
strings okay

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:33.280
so black hole is different from empty
space empty space you know right where

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:38.719
there's nothing no air also okay uh so
they're saying with the first ball

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:42.560
theory this fuz ball is different from
the empty space still a theory it's

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:47.840
important to remember that the fuz ball
proposal is also still a theoretical

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:51.600
idea nobody has tested it nobody knows
if it's true or not it's not something

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:55.600
we directly observed scientists are
still working on it and trying to find

01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:59.120
evidence to support or disprove it
they're still trying to see whether it's

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:02.159
true or not in short this article
explains a cool and different way to

01:31:00.639 --> 01:31:06.080
think about black holes instead of a
simple point in the middle where physics

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:11.040
goes crazy it suggests they might be
giant fuzzy balls made of tiny strings

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:15.600
this could potentially solve some of the
weird mysteries about black holes and

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:19.920
might help us understand better how
gravity and quantum mechanics work

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:23.639
together okay this is giving a better
explanation for some of the things but

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:30.320
they don't know whether this is true or
not now did we understand that article

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:35.600
yes see you are able to understand this
such a complicated scientific article i

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:42.719
won't be able to understand this
but AI did no it's not AI but even if we

01:31:40.239 --> 01:31:47.239
read it we should be able to understand
this part this part we should be able to

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:54.320
understand just by reading the
introduction abstract and conclusions

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:59.400
okay okay
and this is the part that we should be

01:31:56.639 --> 01:32:05.320
able to understand for any
paper actually let's do this let's save

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:11.440
this
uh so how should I do i'll make it as 2

01:32:09.679 --> 01:32:15.719
something okay these are just examples
right yes so 2.1

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:25.760
I think two you can just keep two no I I
have other articles I'll put there

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:31.280
science and research science and No it's
not this research projects scientific

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:41.560
publications and grants how to study
scientific papers posters okay not this

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:41.560
no PDF

01:32:48.800 --> 01:33:00.560
why is it saving as a HTML document
actually I know why why you can go on

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:00.560
that and change it no it's not

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:03.920
changing

01:33:07.159 --> 01:33:11.040
download PDF

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:21.320
okay class material science science and
textbook no research projects and

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:27.960
publications how to
study and in this

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:37.840
two black
holes paper black holes fuz paper right

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:46.880
uh when was this published 2005
I think 17 years ago I said so

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:54.080
2008 okay uh-huh is that correct 2008
date where does it say 2018 here so it

01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:58.600
was published so it was accepted on this
date and available on the published date

01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:06.159
on this date
okay so this is the article right

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:16.719
and then this is the actual
uh summary of that article so let's

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:19.719
copy okay i'll make it 2.1
2.1

01:34:27.679 --> 01:34:30.679
2.1

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.400
Why does it say two copies

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:42.120
it's okay 2.1
2.1

01:34:42.199 --> 01:34:54.679
M and then what
2.1 actually paper AI

01:34:50.679 --> 01:34:54.679
summary okay

01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:01.520
uhhuh uh I don't know why it says how to
read scientific

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:10.360
articles it's not copy right
maybe it

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:28.960
Sir can you keep the last question over
here it will be so better

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.960
it's okay we'll see black

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:38.920
horse summarize this article

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:50.800
so this is actually good because we know
that it does not know the article unless

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:55.520
we if we just give a link it found some
other article right some other random

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:58.880
article yes
if you give the name I think it

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:08.000
knows okay so this is a very good
summary so this kind of summary I want

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:13.760
you to write just by reading the article
okay how can I write you can write so

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:19.199
I'll I'll find some simple article okay
mhm

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:23.719
and so this is a review article right so
should we do it for this also

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:30.760
how many pages

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:35.760
actually amdala and

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.719
emotion so let's summarize this article

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:52.239
okay summarize this article for a 15
year

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.239
old but the article is

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:07.440
different okay this scientific article
is about a small but super important

01:37:05.679 --> 01:37:10.480
part of your brain called the amygdala
think of the amydala as your brain's

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:14.719
emotional headquarters especially for
things like fear but also for other

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:19.520
emotions headquarter means like the main
building amigdala is like the main

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:24.080
building in our brain here is the
breakdown for you what is amigdala the

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:28.159
fear center learning fear beyond fear
connections to other brain areas

01:37:25.679 --> 01:37:35.679
amagdala in action in simple term and if
you read you'll be able to understand

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:38.400
okay mhm let's try and read this summary
so I just save

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.800
this UPDF

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:54.960
save as amigdala and emotion and when
was this uh paper

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:57.960
published to 1996
1996

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:07.560
this is 2.2 two right yes

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.320
and
emotion 1996

01:38:23.159 --> 01:38:29.880
yeah and then I'll put the summary also

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:41.920
rename Ren
name AI

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:49.440
some okay earlier you would have to look
up for news articles you'll have to find

01:38:47.119 --> 01:38:55.920
some news articles which did something
like this now we don't need that okay so

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:59.880
actually how to read scientific articles
in that I'll update this

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:09.080
you explore reputable science news
websites

01:39:11.719 --> 01:39:20.159
alternatively you can use AI
tools to

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:28.400
summarize the
article at the level

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:38.159
of 6 year
old 15 year old etc

01:39:35.719 --> 01:39:46.520
okay this is what we'll probably do
these days you don't really need

01:39:40.679 --> 01:39:46.520
to explore it why did you keep it

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:55.920
okay this this is what we'll use
actually yeah why did you keep that

01:39:51.920 --> 01:40:02.960
itallic it's okay so it's easier to see
it's different from this title right

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:05.360
or I'll just change this and make the
color

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.880
different okay

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:16.360
now this is 2.1 amdala in amigdala

01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:19.920
so here we have to do

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:54.080
this okay so
What will you do what's your homework

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:59.440
going to be um to f you can find another
simple paper for me that I can read and

01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:06.159
then I think we can make this summary
yeah right actually let's follow the

01:41:06.679 --> 01:41:16.400
steps types of how to read a scientific
paper we have the steps right

01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:16.400
yes sir

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.600
step by

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:32.040
step follow the step bystep
process you

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:41.480
described
about to read scientific papers to read

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:47.280
scientific papers and describe those
steps for this article

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:52.400
well which article what topic do you
want rockets black holes space anything

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:56.880
like it doesn't matter
what

01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:02.960
rockets black holes you tell me a new
topic a new topic

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:09.920
yeah what What do you want to learn
about about

01:42:06.159 --> 01:42:19.840
planets and uh like sun and earth no huh
i want to learn about Mars how Mars work

01:42:15.159 --> 01:42:27.199
mars what mars atmosphere mars mars how
it works life on Mars no how it works

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:33.719
how it works meaning how it rotates no
um Mars

01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:33.719
okay surface

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:44.480
um who lives in Mars
life on Mars yes life on Mars

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:48.480
search for life on Mars like new article
let's say these are old articles right

01:42:46.639 --> 01:42:54.320
let's say we want to look for a new
paper the search for ancient life on

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:59.760
Mars using some analysis
okay that's quantitative analysis of

01:42:56.639 --> 01:43:03.960
Martian image evidence of life this has
a PDF so let's do this

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:15.119
uh perspectives on Mars sample return a
critical source for planetary

01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:17.440
science so these are PDFs somewhere they
don't have

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:31.119
PDFs okay quantitative analys of Martian
images wages evidence of

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:36.400
life okay so this is something about
life on

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:40.159
Mars okay using some soil and other
things it doesn't matter how many pages

01:43:38.239 --> 01:43:47.119
you will only read the abstract right
you'll read the title abstract

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:51.480
introduction it's okay and then I wrote
this is the

01:43:49.239 --> 01:43:56.320
uh where the
well what do they

01:43:53.639 --> 01:44:00.639
have these are references so you don't
need to read anything there these are

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:06.440
just links to other papers right and
then future challenges here they're

01:44:02.719 --> 01:44:06.440
describing their

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:13.440
uh
results okay so these are all their

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:24.400
results and no just see
uh so for this paper we'll ask EI to do

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:29.520
it i'll find another paper you just try
to understand how much you can okay

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:35.119
actually let's do a paper on karnatic
music you try and understand that paper

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:40.560
okay you'll be able to do that that'll
be good and then we can also do it for

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:47.080
AI and like schooling those kind of
things because that's our project right

01:44:42.159 --> 01:44:47.080
that we'll do yeah in the classroom

01:44:47.719 --> 01:44:57.159
yeah quantitative analysis of Martian
images okay

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:06.800
so this is
2.3 and 2025 paper wait uh this is

01:45:04.199 --> 01:45:11.040
Mars evidence evidence means proof of
life evidence of

01:45:12.199 --> 01:45:19.679
life
2025 okay so that's the paper yeah

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:26.880
now let's ask AI to do

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:34.280
this follow the step-by-step process you
described about to read scientific

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.040
papers and describe those steps for this
article those steps to understand this

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:50.800
article finding the article we already
got it right

01:45:49.119 --> 01:45:54.000
we approaching the article title and
abstract since I don't have the abstract

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:57.800
right in front of me I'll make some
educated guesses why it does not have

01:45:56.239 --> 01:46:01.600
the
article jumping to the

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:12.440
conclusion no it says it does not have
the article so

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:18.400
actually
for to describe to understand this

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:26.400
article but because we downloaded it we
can just

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.080
use Google Drive

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.320
uh or we upload

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.679
that files

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:49.960
Where is this home school class
material science research project

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:57.080
scientific
publications this

01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:01.719
uh it did not download why is it not
there it did not download

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:16.560
save we just downloaded this
right

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:30.000
2.3 oh maybe I used a different name no
it's not there

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:30.000
2.3 Mars Life

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:42.960
202 okay so that's the paper now we have
it

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.960
now I'll add it from

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:52.199
drive recent no start 2.3 Mars life

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.760
let's see

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:08.800
okay let's break down the scientific
article step by step to make it easier

01:48:06.159 --> 01:48:11.360
the article is titled this okay finding
the article we have the full article

01:48:10.159 --> 01:48:15.840
which is great we already have the
article title tells us the main topic

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:20.639
the other is using quantitative analysis
analyzing with numbers on pictures from

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:26.400
Mars to look for evidence of life okay
so they took some pictures of Mars using

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:32.960
telescope or something okay they have a
rocket and that went and then uh

01:48:30.719 --> 01:48:38.080
they took some they took some pictures
and use they're using that to see

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:42.639
whether there is life approaching the
article title and abstract title

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:48.560
breakdown qualitative analysis means
other is using qual quantitative right

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:54.719
he's using some numbers of Martian
images like images of Mars evidence of

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.880
life to check for whether there is life
on

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:03.520
uh Mars now or previously abstract
summary the abstract tells us many that

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.600
many photos from Mars rovers show
details of Martian landscape reading the

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.080
introduction introduction uction gives
us more

01:49:08.679 --> 01:49:17.600
background jump to the conclusion then
tackling the tricky parts you you can

01:49:14.719 --> 01:49:24.080
read this Vata okay just try to see try
to understand this part okay it has done

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:29.360
all the steps right
right whatever steps that we learned

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:36.159
before like step by step how to read
scientific articles it followed those

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:41.960
steps for this article okay
so that's what we will do so let's add

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:41.960
that

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.760
uh so

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:58.159
this
2 so this is how you'll read a

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:58.159
scientific article okay that's what it's

01:49:59.239 --> 01:50:06.119
showing
AI step by step

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.159
so you read

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:35.840
this it did not copy it

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:44.560
no we don't need the

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:54.480
prompt query successful
what query successful it's not

01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:01.639
saving
why maybe it's too much

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:12.880
finding article abstract summary i I did
it until step four okay uhhuh until step

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:20.520
four
then from step five

01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:42.280
okay yes now let's check why this is qu
successfully copy again

01:51:38.639 --> 01:51:50.080
i don't know that's
okay step three step four step five step

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:56.239
six step seven okay so these are the
steps

01:51:51.920 --> 01:52:03.960
here in doing this now we'll find one
other article

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:10.000
uh scholar and then katic
music what do you want to do do you want

01:52:06.639 --> 01:52:15.920
a review paper or
music ragas identifying ragas in Indian

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:21.719
raga identification of karnatic music
for music information

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:28.040
retrieval okay so this is some
paper you just try and understand what

01:52:24.719 --> 01:52:28.040
they're doing

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:38.800
hey this is four pages it's simple right
yes so you can do this but not 44 pages

01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:44.880
so you don't have to read everything try
and understand this part then read the

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:48.960
abstract then read this then read the
conclusion then try and understand what

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:56.840
they do
follow those steps as in that

01:52:51.639 --> 01:53:03.400
example okay so 2.4
for Raa

01:53:00.199 --> 01:53:07.000
identification karnatic
music right when was this published I

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:12.320
don't
know 2009 I'll change the

01:53:13.159 --> 01:53:19.360
name actually you know what I'll also do
something else for

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:28.800
you maybe maybe I'll not do this so you
try to do the step by step next time

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:37.440
I'll summarize this for you okay and
we'll do the stepby-step process

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:41.599
also what's the year 2009 right
identification karnatic music is that

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:50.280
what it was called identification
karnatic music

01:53:44.199 --> 01:53:50.280
okay so now let's write the class notes

01:54:11.599 --> 01:54:20.360
uh so let's write the nodes and we'll be
done

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:23.840
okay nodes class
nodes create

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:38.119
notepad class notes what's the date
um

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:43.280
0205
2025 science oh I have to do something

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:46.960
else
what exercises i'll give you some

01:54:45.119 --> 01:54:51.360
exercises okay because there's a lot of
material that you learn but this is all

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:56.560
that we have to learn if you understand
this that's all about scientific

01:54:53.199 --> 01:55:02.239
articles even until you grow up
that's all

01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:06.080
oh that's about the process of writing
scientific articles or reading

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:11.679
scientific articles these are the same
steps whether I do it I I am actually

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:14.679
doing research right I also do the same
things

01:55:28.119 --> 01:55:33.760
So 2nd
May

01:55:34.679 --> 01:55:41.480
25
scientific articles

01:55:43.199 --> 01:55:48.840
how to read and then what did we learn

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:57.320
um how to read and then the step-by-step
process of how to read scientific

01:55:53.360 --> 01:56:03.400
articles yeah and then types of and then
types of

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:11.679
articles and we also did types
of scientific research yes right both of

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:15.239
them so I wrote T and F the same way yes
so I erased

01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:22.679
scientific
research then we did

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.679
example
articles

01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:28.960
AI

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.679
summaries step by step

01:56:35.719 --> 01:56:45.560
uh step by step
what a summaries and stepbystep

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:53.040
uh
reading of article right

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.040
what's your

01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.639
homework for

01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:06.000
article 2.4
4 on karnatic

01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:15.320
music
follow this step by

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:18.880
step
process to

01:57:20.679 --> 01:57:28.719
understand follow the stepbystep process
to

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:32.880
understand to understand it okay that's
one homework and the other

01:57:33.239 --> 01:57:42.040
homework is I have to go
here my

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:48.920
drive home
school class material scientific

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:52.880
research research projects
scientific how to study

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:58.159
scientific papers

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.760
Okay

01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:11.679
so
using all the

01:58:07.719 --> 01:58:11.679
documents in this

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:16.440
folder create

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:25.880
uh how many 50
50 homework exercises

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:40.760
50 homework exercises with multiple
choice fill in the blanks

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:44.960
etc fill in the blanks matching
etc type of

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:49.760
questions 50 50 is enough I think

01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:59.480
there are no documents so I cannot
create

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.480
homework but

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:07.840
oh we have to say using the documents
using all the Google

01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:15.199
okay using all the Google Docs google

01:59:16.119 --> 01:59:24.599
Docs in the
folder which folder

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:36.480
one dot how to study scientific papers
and posters right create 50 homework

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:36.480
exercises in multiple the type of

01:59:38.679 --> 01:59:45.440
questions or we just have to make it
into PDFs this folder contains various

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:48.239
resources and documents related to
understanding analyzing and writing

01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:52.159
scientific papers as well as related
topics such as research reproducibility

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:55.920
and the publication process here are 50
homework exercises which section of a

01:59:54.239 --> 02:00:01.599
scientific paper is like a movie trailer
providing a brief overview why don't

01:59:59.119 --> 02:00:07.840
highlight the answers it's highlight
showing the answers already right we

02:00:04.639 --> 02:00:07.840
don't want it to show the

02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:19.960
answers don't show the answers

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:26.239
don't show the

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:37.000
answers so we have to create another
document

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:42.840
here right so I'll
create there's so many Google Docs here

02:00:43.159 --> 02:00:46.159
yeah

02:00:49.719 --> 02:00:53.360
actually next 10

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:09.400
Google I'll just call it
two okay one two because this is for two

02:01:08.159 --> 02:01:12.960
right
uh two

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.760
AI
homework

02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:21.760
exercises
on

02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:32.760
scientific articles
scientific articles peer

02:01:28.679 --> 02:01:32.760
review etc

02:01:33.599 --> 02:01:42.800
now did it give let's create those
homework exercises multiple choice what

02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.800
is the primary purpose

02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:55.440
of abstract to list all others to
provide a

02:01:52.199 --> 02:01:59.000
detail to get the results which section
of a scientific paper should contain a

02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:05.040
detailed description of experimental
procedure what is open access i don't

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:09.520
understand this can you ask for a what i
don't understand these questions what

02:02:07.599 --> 02:02:14.400
why which section of a scientific paper
should contain a detailed description of

02:02:11.119 --> 02:02:20.400
experimental procedure procedure means
process how you're doing the experiment

02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:26.920
which section will have it to produce to
provide a detailed methodology

02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:32.880
methodology detailed
methods like to describe your methods in

02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:40.000
detail uh-huh
or should I say

02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:40.000
it create 50 homework

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:53.800
exercises use the language uh use the
language of six year old not six year

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:59.119
language of 15 year
old well actually this is fine vata what

02:02:57.119 --> 02:03:03.199
do you not understand in this what does
open access and scientific publishing

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.880
mean we learned about open access right
the journal is is available only to

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:10.880
experience research is free for anyone
to access the others pay to have the

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:16.639
paper published research is kept secret
which what's the answer um research is

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:20.320
free for anyone to know it right what is
peer review in the context of scientific

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:24.480
publication reviewed by friends of the
other reviewed by general public

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:29.920
evaluated by other experts in the field
reviewed by journal editor

02:03:27.679 --> 02:03:35.840
general editor is the general editor
going to review it no who is going to

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:40.920
review it general public public you are
going to review some research on black

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:40.920
holes

02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:53.040
um reviewing by the friends or author no
h read all of the options

02:03:50.159 --> 02:03:58.440
reviewing by the friends reviewing by
the general public

02:03:55.679 --> 02:04:05.639
evaluating by other
