# ClassMaterial

Currently, all material is for Grade 1 in our homeschool. Follow ClassDiary (md file) to see the class details for each school day in sequence. Each class also has a corresponding "ClassNotes_<date>_<subject>.pdf" file in its subject subfolder. The files/contents of each subject subfolder are ordered sequentially with prefixes 1., 2., 3. etc. along with date and one can follow them in that sequence to follow the course/teaching materials for that subject. 

Eg: To follow programming class material, go to its subfolder (ClassMaterial/2. MathsProgrammingTechnology/2. Programming/), and see "1.ClassNotes\*.pdf" for notes from the first class, "2.ClassNotes\*.pdf" for the second class and so on.  Any other material associated with a class will have the same prefix. For example, for the sixteen class, "16.ClassNotes\*pdf" shows the class notes, "16.Loops.pdf" is additional material for that class, while "16.HW\*" shows the associated HW exercises.
