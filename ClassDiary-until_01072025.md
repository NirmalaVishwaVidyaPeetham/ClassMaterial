   4. Waves on a rope  
   5. Save some wave images from program with parameter changes for easier reading later  
3. Music notes from frequency.. not midi..  harmonics using flute C4\*nu \= 2\*C3\*nu..  C1 to C2 to C3  etc. each time frequency is doubling..   
   1. Understand how to convert for different scales and notes  
   2. A harmonic is a wave or signal whose frequency is an integral (whole number) multiple of the frequency of the same reference signal or wave.

4. Waves display visually wavelength etc. and also play audio  and see how different properties change it..   
   1. For a given set of swaras, write code that plays those notes in piano/harmonium style – changing duration \- and attenuation  
   2. Play those swaras in carnatic music style and in hindustani music style.. When moving from one swara to next, doesn’t go in steps, but make it continuous..   
5. write a program function that prints swaras and plays arohana avarohana based on raaga number  
6. Write code to simulate timbre of different instruments when playing a note (along with its harmonics)   
   1. Timbre will be akin to different Fourier sums .. coefficients change from one instrument to another  
   2. Simulate waves as sin/cosine waves.. then their amplitudes will change for timbres..   
7. Also combine wave images and music notes playing  
8. Show in code the differences between carnatic and hindusthani style singing  
9. Write code to recognize our singing swaras.. Plot the timbre for each swara we are singing.. Not just the highest note harmonic..

  * Save these wiki files  
  * Graha bhedamnterm meaning – cycle difference? graham like a cycle..  
  * Find all melakatthas that are grahabhedas of each other.. 29th (all white) vs. (29+36) in C vs G scales.. like wise find other raagas from using same notes but starting from diff. scales..   
  * SaPaSa  
* 72 melakartha 12 chakra names meanings  
* 72 melakartha \- divide into graha bhedams  
* Thaalas types \- also practice chumta with udu..   
* Practice some sequence or pattern in different raagas.. also spontaneous practice in diff ragas..   
  * when practicing in some raaga, if u press a wrong note in between, we can immediately hear and notice it.. perhaps there is some natural reason why there are 8 steps in a scale.. find our the reason..   
  * HW: For a diff. raaga make 20 patterns for sarali swaras..   
  * Listen to a song and tey to tell which raaga it is.. like bhaje manjunatham shivam song.. found to be sa ri1 ga2 ma2 pa da1 ni3 sa.. 45th melakattha subhapankuravali.. someone on youtube said the same..   
* Distraction practics \- while wrong notes are playing sing the correct notes  
* When singing Sa1 in C scale, we are not just singing C1 but also it's harmonics, C2, C3 etc.. based on whichever has highest intensity, vocal pitch monitor might show that note.. but when we move from Sa1 towards  Sa2, our tambre might be changing in such a way that we are going from Sa1 to Sa3 instead even though some Sa2 is there.. which makes it then difficult to do the higher notes..   
  * this is the hypothesis why sometimes Virata had difficulty singing higher notes  
  * test this by making python code to detect all harmonics we are singing and their intensities.. plot from c d e f to c etc. on x axis .. but plot different scales in different colors.. yhen when we are singing some note say Sa1, we will will have peak of blue curve at C1 with higher intensity or height, but C2 peak in green is also there but with lower intensity.. then when we go to ri1, … sa2, see hiw these different colored curves are changing.. that will coearly show us our mistakes.. you can also hear this in practice without using any code..   
* Hasal ali break down of the song: add at the top \- Raaga, Aarohana, Avarohana, Thaalam; And then for the swaras, we need to add timing info also may be break into boxes, or use underscores etc, one for each beat   
  * pa\_ paða	paðani ðapa	ma\_ ɡasa	ɡama pa\_  
  * May be find a better way still if side by side there are smaller beat swaras etc. .. if there are 16 beats per llne, may be break down everything at that level   
* Types of thaalas  
  * 35 beat cycle udu practice , 7 beat, 11 beat cycles also  
* Arohana vs avarohana — acceptable sequences  
* 72 melakartha raagas for these 16 swara bhedaas/variations..   
  * function to get notes from raaga number or vice versa  
* Shift of axis/scales.. for same song.. how to get diff. swaras with shift of axes.. backwards forwards..   similar to coordinate transformation in maths… this would be a 1d system..  can we rotations as well? make it 2D? using gaps/chandassu as 2nd dimension.. and then do some rotations and shifts? plot these projections in 2d and see relation with music.. add another dimension and then get spontaneous chaos out in music..   
  * Equivalence in c scale of sarigama vs padanisa so can be shifted easily.. c scale vs g scale.. only ni changes.. show with virata shiva song starting from ni ri ri, or ga pa pa  
    * So on flute when u start sa from bottom everything is full holes ( no halves) in G scale .. maybbe flutes were designed this way.. but when u start at C it becomes half ma..   
* Sasasari Gagagari Sasasari gagagari sasariri gagariri sasariri gagamama .. pattern up and down..

* All white.. but ga and da twice longer.. all else only once long.. what do u call such rule? part of raaga \+ thaal mix .. now 4 beat thaalm fits like this.. sarigaa rigaama gaamapa mapadaa padaano daanisa sanidaa nidaapa daapama pamagaa magaari gaarisa.. also try spontaneously singing with this rule like we are doing for a raaga..   sarigaa risarigaamapama gaarisa sanidaa nisanidaapamapa daanisa..

* Raagas 72 list and how they come.. how to compute also n program ..   
* Each week spontaneous singing of swaras while the other..   
  * one makes up a spontaneous sequence of a line.. then the other plays it on instrument.. or instrument first n den the other sings.. then switch singer and instrument.. so 4 sets on the whole..   
* Each week each of us learn one Sahaj bhajan n practice  
  * Write the song each line, prathipadaardham, chandassu  
  * Have to learn meanings also  
  * Since swaranjali has notes but not raaga.. May be we can play song and use vocal pitch monitor to determine which swaras are used, and based on that can determine which melakartha/janyu raaga it is..   
  * Then play the song in different scales

   2. How do we know two people perceive the same way? May be leaves look blue to me and red to other person.. but we both learnt to call it green since young so both our descriptions match.. but we perceive things differently underneath..  and more complex situations may lead to more subtle differences in perceptions.. reality as midhya or maya.. what did Socrates teach about such things?  
   3. Suppose we don't have eyes.. how will we perceive the world ? think of single celled beings.. how do they perceive? Using physical touch? Chemicals that are around them?

  * change to clockwise not anti.. then spiral ends at the base and heart shape on right side.. then kundalini at the base.. mooladhara chakra.. then left channel upwards to the top, then brain, then downwards right channel, then central channel..   left channel could be at the point tangential to first half turn so 7 intersections, while for right the same distance gives six intersections ..   
  * Chapter9.. how from the top pranava splits at brain prism and splits into the three channels..  heart first pulation ishwarinpower then the three powers .. what's the order? mahalakshmi, sarswathi mahakali outside? .. then at the bottom in kundalini also we have 3.5 coils.. like a fractal?  so this keeps going the same way to Virata upwards as well?   
  * simulate the stages before this also.. valaya to heart to egg hatching aum..   
  * Aum branches shape in zygote egg hatching to how it relates to body shape spine   
  * Heart shape asymmetry top bottom  
  * Chapter10 .. from valaya enter brain and then come down along three channels (also forms ardhabindu and bindu).. in the brain seven chakras separated by grooves along the sushumna.. are these the grooves on brain like between frontal parietal occipital etc. .. compare this with half ellipse in the furst chapter with six chakra gods ..   
  * Ch. 14 \- Sun on right channel intersection bottom , moon on left channel intersection with void..  heart ishwari power and emits pulsations in 3.5 coils..
