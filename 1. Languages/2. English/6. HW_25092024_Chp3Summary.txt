Corrected:
1. Anu went to a 10 petalled gate blocking the tunnel where the water took the shape of a human.
2. It asked Anu 'if you have 2 chocolates, how many should your friend Rita have to make you happy?' for which Anu said it didn't matter how many and that they could share hers, so the gate opened.

AI Summary:
