AI Summary:

In Chapter 2, Anu encounters (meets) a swan who tells her a story about a boy named Sham, who is torn (confused) between seeking help from a mystic or following his mother's advice to achieve his artistic (like painting, music and other arts) goals. Anu correctly discerns that Sham should heed (pay attention to; listen to) his mother's wisdom (to know what is right or wrong), and she is rewarded with a passage through the gate and a newfound (newly found) sense of creativity (ability to create things - like art) and happiness.
